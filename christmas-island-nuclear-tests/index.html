<p>Pin On Nuclear Tests It was part of the Grapple nuclear test series which involved nine explosions over Christmas Island Kiritimati and Malden Island in the central Pacific Ocean between November 1957 and September 1958. Despite paying out to Derek the government says there is no proven link to increased levels of cancer in nuclear test veterans. Twenty of these shots were to test. Many thousands of service personnel deployed to the south Pacific including Christmas Island from 1956 to 1961 were in support of testing the UKs first thermo- nuclear weapon system. So what was done by the governments of the US UK Australia and France to help those who have suffered from radiation related illnesses or those who lost their loved ones.</p>

At Christmas Island MoD records show safety measures observed at earlier smaller tests were thrown out of the window in Op Grapple to get an H-Bomb before an imminent testing ban. When the explosions went off. Most of these shots were conducted with free-fall bombs dropped from B-52 bomber aircraft. The British nuclear weapon tests on Kiritimati Island had profound and lasting cultural consequences for both atomic veterans and local.</p>
