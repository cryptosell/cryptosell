However, d ue to worsening health conditions, the chalets of the christmas markets will not take place in the city this year. Over 300 wooden chalets, spread around different squares in the city, invite you to make some mesmerising discoveries in a fairytale atmosphere! It’s also home to the “christkindelsmärik” a spectacular christmas market and one of the oldest in europe. Strasbourg christmas market safety in 2018, the strasbourg christmas markets were the scene of a deadly terrorist attack that resulted in the death of 5 and injury of 11.</p>

<p>Christmas Market, Strasbourg (Dec 2018) christmas market The christmas markets of strasbourg—the biggest city in alsace—began back in 1570, making it the oldest in france. The christmas market in strasbourg is the oldest in france and one of the oldest in europe. It draws in approximately 2 million visitors each year and since the arrival of tgv service in strasbourg in 2007, the number of visitors has been on the rise. Impressive, for such a small area. Other times, it’s known as the christkindelsmärik in alsatian — a dialect of german spoken in the eastern region of france known as alsace.</p>

<p>La Petite Alsace, Christmas in Strasbourg, France Of course, there are many christmas markets around the world, and particularly in germany , but the strasbourg christmas market seems to have an extra twinkle in its eye. Over 300 wooden chalets, spread around different squares in the city, invite you to make some mesmerising discoveries in a fairytale atmosphere! Another strasbourg christmas market where you can stock up on gifts from local producers is the alsatian delicacies market, probably my personal favourite of all the christmas markets in the city. Enjoy the trip of your dreams thanks to more than 300 stalls, kilometres of fairy lights, the majestic great christmas tree, dazzling shows and concerts, and an unforgettable christmas. In front of the city’s magnificent cathedral, under the giant christmas tree, among the stalls of france’s largest christmas market, strasbourg invites you to share in the most marvellous festive season.</p>
