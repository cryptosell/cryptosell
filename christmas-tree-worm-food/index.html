<p>End0skeletal Christmas Tree Worms Spirobranchus Giganteus Are Tube Building Segmented Bristle Worms Weird Sea Creatures Deep Sea Creatures Sea Creatures Once the worm catches the food it is then passed down the food groove by the feeding pinnules. Since it is purely a filter feeder the diet of the Christmas Tree Worm should be supplemented with liquid plankton-based foods. The eyes on their head arent much use as they cant see out of the tube and into the surrounding water but the radiolar crowns more than compensate with their 360-degree surveillance system. The food particles are sorted but larger particles are discarded. The Christmas Tree Worm is normally shipped with several individuals attached to a small peice of live rock or rubble.</p>

<p>Spirobranchus Giganteus Or Christmas Tree Worm Fractals In Nature Ocean Creatures Sea Animals They arent very big averaging about 15 inches in length. The spirobranchus giganteus live in the ocean and sports two magnificent spirals of plumes that protrude from its tube-like body and which look like tiny Christmas trees. Its hard to count but I would guess there to be at least 30 or as many as 50 worms on it. The heavily ciliated radioles move the food into the worms mouth. Some worms are covered in hairs for protection scavenging on the sea floor for detritus.</p>

<p>Christmas Tree Worms In 2021 Deep Sea Creatures Coral Reef Art Colorful Animals The intricate feather-like structures filter planktonic food out of the water as it flows by. Shane Down who managed to capture footage of the event said it was the first time hed ever seen Christmas tree worms spawning despite amny years spent on the reef. Like most tube worms Christmas tree worms need sustained healthy feeding to survive. These twin Christmas trees that appear to grow out of coral heads are actually appendages of the worms mouth and are used for feeding and respiration. The Christmas tree worm eats by catching ciliates zooplankton organic waste phytoplankton and other food scraps with their radioles.</p>
