<p>Holidays to Kangaroo Island Bespoke Australia Holidays Kuala lumpur, dec 3 — christmas came early for one australian family when they came home to a wild koala that perched itself on their beautifully decorated tree. The misguided marsupial apparently slipped into the mccormicks’ aidelaide home while the doors were open and scaled the tree after they left that afternoon. Adelaide and hills koala rescue initially thought it was a prank when amanda mccormick called to report the koala on her tree. Adelaide, sa — an australian family came home to find a surprise ornament in their christmas tree. The mccormicks went for a silver, pink and blue theme on their christmas tree.</p>
